# Stash

- Just finished some config file changes to made it easier to understand when reading
- Updated the README so that it is up-to-date and easy to understand

- [ ] Enforce worktree folders is `../` starting
- [ ] Add a `repoRootFolder` and enforce `../` starting
- [ ] Sync the template file
- [ ] Sync one of each of the input files in corresponging output folder

- [ ] Would like to add an `init` argument to initialize a repo
- [ ] Would like to add an `add` argument to add a worktree (maybe) that also maybe uses git worktree to do it? Not sure, maybe it's too much.
- [ ] Would like to add a `sync` argument that optionally takes the config file path
- [ ] Need to test on a test repo in a tests directory
